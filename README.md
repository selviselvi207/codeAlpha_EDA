📊 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, and factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

EDA is an essential step in data analysis that helps in understanding the structure and quality of data before applying machine learning models.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset

Ask meaningful questions before analysis

Analyze relationships between variables such as gender, age, and passenger class

Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies

Detect missing values, outliers, and data quality issues

Validate assumptions using statistics and visualizations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset

Source: Public Titanic Dataset

Format: CSV

Features include: Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, etc.

🔍 Key Insights

Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in higher classes had better survival chances

Age and fare showed significant variation and outliers

Missing values were found in Age and Cabin columns

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how EDA helps uncover meaningful insights from raw data and prepares the dataset for further preprocessing and modeling. It is a beginner-friendly project suitable for learning data analysis concepts.
